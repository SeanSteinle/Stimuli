# Stimuli

BRIEF:
We can use this platform as a place to develop, share, and evaluate our current model. 
I'll be routinely working with the platform, so if you feel like using Git/Github, you can 
absolutely submit pull requests and I'll confirm them.

CONTENTS:

README.md - here
Stimuli.xlsx - excel file of experimental data, courtesy of Lin
