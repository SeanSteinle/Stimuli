## Models of Surprisal Calculation

**Brief**:<br>
We can use this platform as a place to develop, share, and evaluate our current model. 
I'll be routinely working with the platform, so if you feel like using Git/Github, you can 
absolutely submit pull requests and I'll confirm them.

**Contents**:<br>
1. *Stimuli.xlsx* - excel file of experimental data, courtesy of Lin
2. *Stanford_Pickling* - early attempts with the Stanford Tagger, now outdated
3. *Stimuli_DF_and_Objects* - combing through and tagging Stimuli.xlsx data, can be used for future parsing models
4. *Surprisal_Models* - our main script, the current parser model running on our server approach
