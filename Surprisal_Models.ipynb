    "1. Git Bash (https://git-scm.com/downloads)\n",
    "    - This is a modified version of the command line (or terminal in MacOS) that enables the user to download GitHub repositories to their local machine, contribute to these repositories, and then publish their results.\n",
    "    - I'm not going to do a big whole thing on Git here, but I will have you:\n",
    "        - **clone** our repository to your machine, \n",
    "        - **add** a few files, \n",
    "        - **commit** your changes, \n",
    "        - and finally submit a **pull request**.\n",
    "    - Why go through this hassle? Now, you can work with our code on your machine in Juypter, as opposed to having look at it on the GitHub interface!\n",
    "2. Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)\n",
    "    - This is an extremely popular platform for data science work. I think you might already have it, so I won't go into much detail. Basically we'll be using this so we can access Juypter Notebooks (like this one!).\n",

    "1. Sentence Tagging\n",
    "    - sentences -> list of tuples, each tuple has word and tag\n",
    "    - sometimes this step will be consumed by the subsequent parsing step. for example, the Stanford parser accepts raw sentences as input, does the tagging, and then does the parsing.\n",

    "We've spent a lot of time looking at the StanfordCoreNLP software, and we ultimately decided we want to use both the parser and tagger (really, the parser automatically implements the tagger, but we'll see later). While the software is very useful, it's written in Java--which is not quite as nice to play with as Python for a number of reasons (lacks NLP libraries, lower level language, etc). The problem then is finding a way to use a Java program like it's a Python program.<br><br>\n",
    "The two main options I looked into was a traditional import and a private server. One route of solving our problem is to use a traditional \"wrapper\" library/program. This program is essentially a translator between Java and Python. Unfortunately, the Stanford team itself doesn't actually make these wrappers (they would have to make them for a *lot* of languages). The existing wrappers--specifically the <u>stanfordcorenlp</u> library--weren't available through Anaconda (the platform through which we are running this exciting program right now), so I went another route.<br><br>\n",
    "The direction I chose was to host a server that runs the out-of-the-box Java program, and to access it through a Python API. This involves a small amount of command line setup, but it saves the trouble of changing environment variables or using directories in Python.<br><br>\n",
