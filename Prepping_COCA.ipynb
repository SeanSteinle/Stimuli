       "\"##3000589 <p> Some teams improve by adding players . Others make themselves better by getting rid of players . Addition by subtraction , Branch Rickey called it . Then there are the Yankees , who hope to prove that a team that won more games than any other in baseball history can at least repeat as champions , if not match or exceed that victory total , without making any changes . <p> When the Yankees ' pitchers and catchers have their first spring training workout in Tampa , Fla. , on Thursday and when the rest of the World Series winners join them Feb. 23 , they will not have to introduce themselves to each other . They are the same guys who dressed and played together last season . <p> True , Tim Raines will not be there , but he is the lone exception . Every other member of the post-season team will be back in all the old familiar places . Bernie Williams , who seemed certain to leave , stayed when the numbers after the dollar sign got big enough . David Cone could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Girardi , who was virtually gone as an expendable backup catcher , is back . <p> General Manager Brian Cashman could have made some moves just to keep the Yankees alert and prevent them from suffering a major attack of complacency , but he opted instead to follow the policy that says if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it . <p> There was plenty of repair work going on elsewhere this winter , as some teams tried to improve themselves and others tried to mend the holes that were created when players found new addresses . <p> When spring training begins this week -- seven other teams besides the Yankees will start on Thursday , the first day workouts are permitted -- teams will get their first look at the changes they made or were forced to make , or at how gaping are the holes that were left by defections of free agents . <p> The Baltimore Orioles , the team that most desperately wants to knock the Yankees from their lofty American League East perch , will show up with half a new infield , first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place of Rafael Palmeiro and Roberto Alomar ) ; a new catcher , Charles Johnson , and , a new threat to the less than 5-month-old home run record . <p> That threat would be Albert Belle , who brings to the home run haven of Camden Yards a bat that blistered American League pitchers for 31 home runs in the Chicago White Sox 's 76 games after the All-Star break , a total that nearly matched the 33 Mark McGwire hit in St. Louis 's 76 games after the break . <p> The Mets , the team that most desperately wants to knock the Yankees from their lofty New York City perch , open camp Saturday with half a new infield , third baseman Robin Ventura and second baseman Edgardo Alfonzo , and two-thirds of a new outfield , Bobby Bonilla and Rickey Henderson . <p> They retained Mike Piazza by breaking their bank to pay him a subsistence wage , then traded their former catcher , Todd Hundley , to Los Angeles , where the Dodgers shattered their even more well-stocked bank to lure Kevin Brown and his World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever it will take to reach the playoffs . <p> The Yankees , Mets and Dodgers were among the teams that appeared to have the best off seasons . They will have to demonstrate that on the field , of course . <p> The Atlanta Braves , the longest-running division champions ( seven consecutive titles ) , are another team in that category . They bolstered their offense and defense by adding second baseman Bret Boone and right fielder Brian Jordan while sacrificing only a member of the strongest element of their team , pitcher Denny Neagle . <p> The Arizona Diamondbacks , starting their second season , are not in the class of the Yankees and the Braves , but they engaged in a frenzy of winter activity that got everyone 's attention . They bought a substantial part of their pitching rotation , signing Randy Johnson , Todd Stottlemyre and Armando Reynoso , and got two-thirds of a new outfield , Steve Finley and Luis Gonzalez . Severe Winter for 4 Clubs <p> For some teams , the winter has been a mean season . They are the winners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Chicago White Sox , Boston Red Sox and Kansas City Royals . <p> The Royals really do not belong in the other teams ' class because they already were a bad team . But the loss of Dean Palmer ( 34 home runs , 119 runs batted in ) , Jose Offerman ( .315 ) and Tim Belcher ( 14-14 , 234 innings ) can only make them worse . <p> The Padres executed one of the neatest tricks of the off season . A few weeks after their World Series appearance against the Yankees , they induced San Diego voters to approve funding for a new ball park . Then in subsequent weeks they lost Brown , Finley and third baseman Ken Caminiti , then traded Greg Vaughn , who hit 50 home runs for them last season , and pitcher Joey Hamilton . <p> Like their National League champion predecessors , the Florida Marlins , the Padres are a shell of their former self and could return to last place , where they finished the year before they won the pennant . <p> The White Sox -- who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two months left in the 1997 season , pronounced them incapable of contending for the division championship when they were only three games from first -- suffered the loss of two of their three best players . Belle bolted for Baltimore , and Ventura veered to New York . That leaves Frank Thomas , who endured the worst year of his career last season . <p> The Red Sox played out the last act of the yearlong tragedy they created with their No. 1 hero , Mo Vaughn . In that time , they never made Vaughn an offer he could accept . But they did make Bernie Williams an offer Vaughn would not have refused , only to prompt the Yankees to raise their offer to Williams by nearly 50 percent . So on the same day Vaughn signed with Anaheim , Williams re-signed with the Yankees . A few days later Belle opted for the Orioles , and the Red Sox lineup was barren . No big power hitter , no big run producer , no threat . The Manager Watch <p> Two new managers -- that is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention this spring . <p> Davey Johnson , a winner wherever he has managed but a loser in his ability to keep a job , has been given the responsibility of shepherding the nouveau riche Dodgers to the promised land of high-spending teams . Jim Leyland has been given $2 million a year in Colorado to work the magic that made the Rockies ' fellow expansion team , the Marlins , World Series champions in their fifth year of existence . <p> The other new managers are John Boles , who has replaced Leyland , who had replaced him , and Larry Parrish , who begins his first spring training with the Detroit Tigers , whom he managed on an interim basis the final month of last season . <p> Several managers begin spring training with a real or perceived threat to their jobs . One is Bobby Valentine , who has expensive new weapons in his arsenal and an obstacle to overcome : the Mets ' inability to gain the one victory in their last five games last season that would have at least put them in a playoff for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disaster waiting to happen : Ray Miller managed the highest-paid 1998 team to a losing record and had better not do it again . Art Howe barely survived in Oakland last season , and Tim Johnson has to regain credibility in Toronto after he admitted concocting a tale about military service in Vietnam . Alumni Membership Grows <p> Some players will be missing when camps open . They are the players who can begin active membership in the Major League Baseball Players Alumni Association . <p> Paul Molitor has retired after 21 years and 3,319 hits , eighth most in major league history . Dennis Eckersley has retired after 24 years and a major league-record 1,071 games pitched . Dennis Martinez has retired after 22 seasons and 245 victories , most ever by a Latin pitcher . <p> They are joined in their retirement by , among others , Joe Carter , Jimmy Key , Terry Pendleton , Juan Samuel and Bob Tewksbury . Lenny Dykstra , who because of injuries has not played since 1996 and played in more than 85 games only once in his last six active seasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Wohlers <p> The six weeks of spring training will be more critical for some players than for others . Mark Wohlers , for example , should learn whether or not he has a future in baseball . <p> Wohlers is the erstwhile , engimatic closer of the Atlanta Braves who is trying to salvage his career . It had been a steadily growing career until he encountered a loss of control and skills last season . Thirty-three walks in 201/3 innings told the stunning tale of a wicked fastball gone awry . The Braves will scrutinize the appearances of Wohlers in exhibition games this spring . <p> Alex Fernandez of Florida ( rotator cuff ) and Kevin Appier of Kansas City ( shoulder ) are two front-line starting pitchers who are coming back from disabling injuries . If they show they are healthy , they could be traded to teams that like to pay high salaries . The Chicago Cubs also will be watching the elbow of Kerry Wood , who burst onto the major league scene last season with an explosion of strikeouts . <p> The comeback of Todd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minds of the Dodgers . The Yankees will watch Darryl Strawberry and his attempt to overcome colon cancer . <p> Some other matters to watch : Will the Toronto Blue Jays trade Roger Clemens , the Philadelphia Phillies Curt Schilling , the Milwaukee Brewers Fernando Vina ? Will Omar Vizquel accept the contract he signed and not create a problem for the Cleveland Indians ? Will Edgardo Alfonzo make a satisfactory transition from third base to second and advance the Mets ' wild-card cause ? <p> http : //www.nytimes.com \\n\""
